  <h3>Core Values</h3>
  <body>
    <p>My name is Olivia Kim, and I would describe myself as an empathetic and outgoing individual. I think that a person is defined by not only the things that they do, but the values they hold. Qualities such as compassion, dedicated work ethic, patience, and selflessness guide the way I communicate with others and make decisions. Having written traits helps me envision the person I try to be and provides an outline of personal growth I can achieve. I hope to incorporate these values into a future in the business field.

  <h3>Demonstrating My Values in Action</h3>
    <p>I try to be mindful of my actions, ensuring they align with my values. An example of when I apply my values in real-life situations is during the summer when I work as a volunteer at my churchâ€™s VBS program. Oftentimes, I get frustrated or overwhelmed by the chaotic nature of VBS, being surrounded by dozens of small children. However, instead of allowing myself to submit to my frustrations, I assess the situation with patience and work through problems accordingly. This way, I maintain a positive and calm composure, creating a better environment for both myself and the children.</p>

  <h3>Values Guiding My Future Goals</h3>
  <body>
  <p>Using the said traits that I try to shape myself into, I hope to create an impactful future in business. In the business world, particularly business administration and management, the focus is very people-oriented. Thus, it is vital to work cooperatively and selflessly. Recognizing my inherent extroversion and eagerness to work with others, I believe that I can work toward a meaningful future in this category. However, I acknowledge that a successful career is attained through hard work, passion, and dedication, and not just hope and virtue alone. </p>
